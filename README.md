2. Smallest dimension must be at least 600px
3. Memes should strongly resemble other memes using the same macro - i.e. keep the font and layout consistent with existing memes
4. Make your memes with a proper image editor or a word editor so it's easier to make adjustments. Consider using online tools like Google Drive or Figma for easy sharing and collaboration.
5. Add a watermark if you can - they are stored in the watermark folder.
